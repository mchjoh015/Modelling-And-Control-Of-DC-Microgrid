# Modelling and Control of a DC Microgrid

This repository contains the design, modelling, and control implementation of a 48 V DC microgrid integrating renewable energy sources and hybrid energy storage to ensure stable, reliable, and efficient off-grid power delivery. The system is developed in MATLAB/Simulink and demonstrates coordinated converter control, energy management, and DC bus voltage regulation under variable load and fluctuating renewable generation.

##  System Overview

The DC microgrid integrates the following components:

- **Solar PV Array** – primary renewable source with MPPT-controlled boost converter
- **Wind Generator** – secondary renewable source with AC–DC conversion and MPPT
- **Battery** – long-term energy storage for slow power fluctuations
- **Supercapacitor** – high-power storage for fast transient support
- **Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS)** – coordinated use of battery + supercapacitor
- **48 V DC Bus** – regulated bus supplying a variable residential/apartment-type load

The system aims to maintain a constant 48 V DC bus voltage while meeting the varying load demand and compensating for intermittent solar and wind power generation.

## Control & Energy Management

### 1. Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT)

MPPT algorithms are implemented to maximise renewable power harvesting:

- PV MPPT using **Perturb & Observe (P&O)** or **Incremental Conductance (INC)**
- Wind MPPT using **Tip-Speed Ratio (TSR)** or power-coefficient-based control

### 2. Converter-Level Control

All converters are PWM-controlled and designed for dynamic and stable operation:

- **Boost Converters (PV & Wind):** regulate input voltage and track maximum power
- **Bidirectional Buck-Boost Converter (Battery AND Super Capacitor):** handles charging/discharging to balance load and generation

### 3. Energy Management System (EMS)

The EMS coordinates power flow among renewables and storage:

- Allocates **low-frequency** power balancing to the battery
- Assigns **high-frequency** transient support to the supercapacitor
- Ensures efficient use of storage, protects battery health, and improves stability
